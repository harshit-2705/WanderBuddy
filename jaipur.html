        <p id="text2">Nestled like a regal gem in the heart of India, Jaipur is a city that beckons you to step back in
            time and embrace the rich tapestry of history, culture, and vibrant hues that define it. Known as the "Pink City,"
            its ancient sandstone walls and palaces blush with the soft glow of a thousand sunsetsIt was founded by
            Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in November 1727 and also got its name from this brave Hindu ruler.Keeping in mind the several battles fought with the Marathas, Jai Singh was keen on making his city safe and secure. This is why the construction of the city was brilliantly planned and executed. The architecture of the city was certainly ahead of its time and was perhaps the best and the most advanced, at that time, in the Indian subcontinent. Located in
            Northern India, Jaipur is the capital of Rajasthan and also the largest city in this state.It was one of the
            earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. During the British Colonial
            period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State. After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the
            capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> .It was one of the
